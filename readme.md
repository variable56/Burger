# Burger Town

## Overview
This is a full stack application that connects a SQL database (back end) with a client browser (front end). Users will browse to the following URL: https://shielded-savannah-90258.herokuapp.com/. Once there, they can interact with information that is in the database being displayed on the website.  Additionally they can destroy or create entries within the database too.  This application is based on CRUD methodologies.

## Installation
Since this application is browser based, and hosted on Heroku, there is nothing for the user to install and the data in the database is persistant accross browsers.

## Technologies
This application makes use of the mysql, dotenv, express & express-handlebars.  The database that stores all the data, is SQL based.

## Source Code
All of the code is stored within github found here: https://github.com/variable56/Burger.
